What is ZeroGravity CMS?
------------------------

Do you know [Grav](https://getgrav.org/)? It's an awesome flat-file based CMS that
unfortunately does not integrate well into modern CI/build/deploy mechanism.

ZeroGravity CMS is here to solve that. Just pack a handful markdown and YAML files
(or markdown with integrated YAML frontmatter) into your Symfony 3+ project and you
are basically done!
